Hi, I'm Emma, a frontend developer specializing in React with a passion for creating dynamic and engaging user experiences. I'm currently expanding my skillset by learning TypeScript and exploring new front-end technologies.

With a strong focus on clean code and responsive design, I strive to deliver high-quality solutions that exceed expectations. As a problem solver at heart, I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding elegant solutions.

I'm actively seeking opportunities for internships and projects where I can apply my skills and collaborate with others to build amazing products. Let's connect and create something great together!
